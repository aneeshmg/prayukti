Suggested git flow:

All development happens on a dev branch
Before starting development, git pull origin dev -> fix any merge conflicts if any
Write code -> commit -> push to dev branch
End of sprint, ensure application is working (no errors, etc) merge to master branch

For more granularity, we could also have sprint branches instead of just one dev branch. Like:
For sprint 1, sprint-1, etc and at the end of each sprint, we'd merge sprint-x branch into master branch, and at the begining of a sprint, we'd create a new sprint branch
